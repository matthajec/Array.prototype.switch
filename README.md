# Array.prototype.switch

## Description
This is a demo project for Array.prototype.switch
switch is a prototype method of an Array. You call it just like how you'd call map, filter, push, etc. 

## Usage
To use switch, call yourArrayHere.switch(firstIndex, secondIndex). This will modify the array so that the values of indexes 'fistIndex' and 'secondIndex' are swapped.

## Why?
I made this to get a better knowledge of prototypes in javascript.
